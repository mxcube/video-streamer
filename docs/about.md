# About the Video-Streamer

This project is part of the [MXCuBE organization](https://github.com/mxcube), designed to support the transition to the **web version of MXCuBE** while providing compatibility with a variety of image acquisition devices commonly used in **Macromolecular Crystallography** (MX) environments, such as those found in synchrotron facilities around the world.

## Why This Matters

The goal of this project is to modernize the MXCuBE experience by moving from a desktop environment to a more flexible and accessible web-based platform. This will make it easier for researchers to interact with and control their experiments remotely, improving accessibility, collaboration, and efficiency.

## About MXCuBE

MXCuBE (Macromolecular Xtallography Customized Beamline Environment) is an open-source data acquisition software, which started in 2005 at [ESRF](https://www.esrf.fr/). Initially designed for the synchrotron community, it has since grown into a globally adopted solution, used by major institutes worldwide. 

In 2010, a collaboration agreement was signed to further develop MXCuBE between major synchrotron facilities across Europe. Since then, MXCuBE has been expanded and used in facilities around the world, supporting researches in various scientific fields. 

For more information on the organization and its collaborators see the [MXCuBE webpage](https://mxcube.github.io/mxcube).
